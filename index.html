           The Jahnturnhalle, now home to the new Bürger Museum or civic museum, is a place that already represents significant eras in Wolfenbüttel's development through its architectural past and the history of its uses. Many people know this gymnasium from their own experiences of athletic activities. Whether from basketball, boxing, or club and school games, people still remember sporting events in the Jahnturnhalle. The building was, in fact, not originally built as a sport venue, but as an indoor riding arena. After its construction in the mid-19th century, it served as an officers' riding hall until 1929. Thus this building is both a place where civic life and club activities took place and an important testimony to Wolfenbüttel's military history, representing its past as a garrison town.  
The Bürger Museum displays  Wolfenbüttel’s history during the past five centuries. Themed areas show the most significant events and developments: its origins and growth as a town in the shadow of the royal residence; water; industrialisation; bourgeois society in the 19th century; and the 20th century, with its world wars and the post-war era, West German economic miracle, and urban redevelopment. At listening stations, local residents tell their stories, and in doing so, relate the history of Wolfenbüttel itself.
